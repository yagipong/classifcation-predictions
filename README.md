# classifcation-predictions
A project to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of classification modeling using machine learning.

The project sought to determine how features of a dataset might be used to predict a single target vector. In this case, the question the model sought to answer was "How might demographic information predict a person's income level?". The model employed Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor models to forecast predictions, then added Principal Component Analysis to improve the speed and accuracy of the model.

The results of the model indicated that a KNN model using PCA feature engineering provided the highest quality results (in this case, a score of 0.87). This model could be used in a variety of scenarios, such as predicting credit card default rates, market segmentation, or student loan requests.
